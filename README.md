# RCR_encryption
A simple, yet powerful, encryption program based on alphabet rearrangement.
The RCR encryption works on a private-only key system, where the key is a string of characters, each one having a numerical value between 1 and the size of the string (0 will always mean there is a space in the string).
The encryption takes a string and returns a vector of integers, each one representing a character of the original message. The decryption does the exact opposite.
